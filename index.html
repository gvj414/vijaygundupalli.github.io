									<h2><a href="#">Hello, my name is<br />
									Vijay Gundupalli</a></h2>
									<p>I am a travel freak who enjoys the freedom to work remotely from anywhere, it allows me to combine my love of travel with my profession. I'm able to balance work and adventure by carrying my laptop with me and enjoy exploring new places while continuing to use my technical skills.

										As a highly motivated individual, I bring both strong team collaboration skills and extensive experience in developing robust, scalable, and user-friendly APIs and web services using Java, Spring Boot and Hibernate. Additionally, my expertise extends to building highly extensible systems that can adapt to evolving business requirements.</p>
